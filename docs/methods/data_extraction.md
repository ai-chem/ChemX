#### Methodology
The data extraction methodology focuses on the automated extraction of chemical information from scientific literature, utilizing advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques. The ChemX benchmark leverages multimodal datasets, including textual data, tables, and figures, for evaluating automated information extraction systems. The methodology incorporates a comprehensive data curation process, involving manual annotation by domain experts and iterative validation to ensure high accuracy and consistency across various chemical domains such as nanomaterials and small molecules.

#### Tools
To facilitate data extraction, state-of-the-art tools and models are employed. These include large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and LLaMA-4, which are capable of processing multimodal data (text and images). Additionally, the NanoMINER multi-agent system is utilized for extracting structured data from research articles, combining vision-based extraction methods with NLP capabilities. The system integrates YOLO for visual data extraction and GPT-4o for linking textual and visual information, ensuring end-to-end processing with minimal manual intervention.

#### Extraction Process
The data extraction process follows a systematic approach:

1. **Data Collection**: Scientific articles are gathered from a broad corpus of peer-reviewed literature, focusing on chemical publications that include structured tables, unstructured text, and visually grounded references such as figures and plots.
   
2. **Preprocessing**: The raw data is preprocessed to ensure machine-readability. For example, chemical names are standardized into SMILES notation, and figures are manually redrawn to extract chemical structures.

3. **Annotation**: Domain experts annotate various chemical entities, properties, and synthesis protocols, ensuring consistency in the extracted data across different formats.

4. **Model Application**: LLMs like GPT-4o are tasked with extracting key chemical features from both text and images. These models are trained and evaluated using curated datasets to ensure accurate extraction of information such as chemical names, properties, and relationships.

5. **Validation and Quality Control**: A multi-stage validation system ensures the quality and reliability of the extracted data. A subset of annotated samples undergoes cross-checking by independent annotators, and iterative cycles of validation and correction are performed until the error rates converge to an acceptable threshold.

#### Results
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology in extracting chemical data from complex scientific literature. The use of multimodal models, particularly those capable of processing both text and images, significantly improves the accuracy of data extraction. The ChemX benchmark, comprising 11 curated datasets across diverse chemical domains, offers a robust foundation for evaluating and training models in the field of chemical information extraction. Despite the complexity of the task, current models, including LLMs and multi-agent systems, show promising results in automating the extraction process, though challenges remain in terms of performance across different types of data (text vs. images).
