Extract all relevant data points from tables, text, or metadata, mapping them to the dataset's columns.  For each experiment extract the following information:

1. Nanoparticle name: Nanoparticle name (e.g., ""Ag"", ""Au"", ""ZnO""). 
2. Coating: Surface coating/modification (""1"" for coating, ""0"" for none).
3. Bacteria: Bacterial strain tested (e.g., ""Escherichia coli"", ""Staphylococcus aureus"").
4. MDR: Multidrug-resistant strain indicator. Extract as an integer (1 for Yes, 0 for No).
5. Strain: Specific strain identifier (e.g., ""ATCC 25922"").
6. Synthesis: Synthesis method (e.g., ""green_synthesis"", ""chemical_synthesis"", or specific details like ""Green synthesis using Pimpinella anisum""). 
7. Method: Assay type (e.g., ""MIC"", ""ZOI"", ""MBC"", ""MBEC""). 
8. MIC: Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) in μg/mL. 
9. Concentration: Concentration for Zone of Inhibition (ZOI) in μg/mL. 
10. ZOI: Zone of Inhibition in mm. 
11. Sizes:
11.1. Min Size (nm): Minimum nanoparticle size in nm. 
11.2 Max Size (nm): Maximum nanoparticle size in nm. 
11.3 Average size (nm): Average nanoparticle size in nm. 
14. Shape: Morphology (e.g., ""spherical"", ""triangular""). 
15. Time (hours): Experiment duration in hours. 
16. Zeta potential (mV): Surface charge in mV. 
17. Extraction Solvent: Solvent used in green synthesis (e.g., ""water"", ""ethanol""). 
18. Extraction Temperature (°C): Temperature during extract preparation in °C. 
19. Extraction Duration (min): Time to prepare extract in minutes. 
20. Precursor: Chemical precursor (e.g., ""AgNO3""). 
21. Precursor Concentration (mM): Precursor concentration in mM. 
22. Hydrodynamic Diameter: Hydrodynamic size in nm. 
23. Synthesis pH: pH of synthesis solution. 
Additional Instructions
1. Units: Maintain consistency with column descriptions (e.g., nm for sizes, μg/mL for concentrations, °C for temperatures). Do not convert units unless specified in the article.
2. Numeric Flags: For mdr and coating, use 1 for Yes/present and 0 for No/none.
3. Ambiguous Data: If multiple values are reported for a field (e.g., multiple sizes), select the most relevant (e.g., use size measured using TEM) or use ""Nan"" if unclear.
4. Chemical Precursors/Solvents: Extract as strings without parsing into molecular components.
If the article references multiple samples or variations of compounds tested, ensure to extract and compile each unique set of 'np', 'coating', 'bacteria', 'mdr', 'strain', 'np_synthesis', 'method', 'MIC_NP', 'concentration_for_zoi', 'zoi_np', 'np_size_min_nm', 'np_size_max_nm', 'np_size_avg_nm', 'shape', 'time_set_hours', 'zeta_potential_mV', 'solvent_for_extract', 'temperature_for_extract_C', 'duration_preparing_extract_min', 'precursor_of_np', 'concentration_of_precursor_mM', 'hydrodynamic_diameter', 'pH_during_synthesis', information.

164_c9na00017h.pdf,You are a PDF retrieval assistant.,"You are a helpful assistant in chemistry, specializing in antimicrobial nanoparticles.","Your task is to efficiently analyze the content of the provided article PDF and extract nanoparticle properties, bacterial types, and toxicity outcomes, including minimal inhibitory concentration and zone of inhibition, from various research articles assessed through various assays against different bacterial strains. Each article may contain multiple experiments varying by nanoparticle type, size, shape, bacteria, or other parameters. Extract all relevant data points from tables, text, or metadata, mapping them to the dataset's columns.  For each experiment extract the following information:

1. Nanoparticle name: Nanoparticle name (e.g., ""Ag"", ""Au"", ""ZnO""). 
2. Coating: Surface coating/modification (""1"" for coating, ""0"" for none).
3. Bacteria: Bacterial strain tested (e.g., ""Escherichia coli"", ""Staphylococcus aureus"").
4. MDR: Multidrug-resistant strain indicator. Extract as an integer (1 for Yes, 0 for No).
5. Strain: Specific strain identifier (e.g., ""ATCC 25922"").
6. Synthesis: Synthesis method (e.g., ""green_synthesis"", ""chemical_synthesis"", or specific details like ""Green synthesis using Pimpinella anisum""). 
7. Method: Assay type (e.g., ""MIC"", ""ZOI"", ""MBC"", ""MBEC""). 
8. MIC: Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) in μg/mL. 
9. Concentration: Concentration for Zone of Inhibition (ZOI) in μg/mL. 
10. ZOI: Zone of Inhibition in mm.

15. Time (hours): Experiment duration in hours. 
16. Zeta potential (mV): Surface charge in mV. 
17. Extraction Solvent: Solvent used in green synthesis (e.g., ""water"", ""ethanol""). 
18. Extraction Temperature (°C): Temperature during extract preparation in °C. 
19. Extraction Duration (min): Time to prepare extract in minutes. 
20. Precursor: Chemical precursor (e.g., ""AgNO3""). 
21. Precursor Concentration (mM): Precursor concentration in mM. 
22. Hydrodynamic Diameter: Hydrodynamic size in nm. 
23. Synthesis pH: pH of synthesis solution. 
Additional Instructions
1. Units: Maintain consistency with column descriptions (e.g., nm for sizes, μg/mL for concentrations, °C for temperatures). Do not convert units unless specified in the article.
2. Numeric Flags: For mdr and coating, use 1 for Yes/present and 0 for No/none.
3. Ambiguous Data: If multiple values are reported for a field (e.g., multiple sizes), select the most relevant (e.g., use size measured using TEM) or use ""Nan"" if unclear.
4. Chemical Precursors/Solvents: Extract as strings without parsing into molecular components.
If the article references multiple samples or variations of compounds tested, ensure to extract and compile each unique set of 'np', 'coating', 'bacteria', 'mdr', 'strain', 'np_synthesis', 'method', 'MIC_NP', 'concentration_for_zoi', 'zoi_np', 'np_size_min_nm', 'np_size_max_nm', 'np_size_avg_nm', 'shape', 'time_set_hours', 'zeta_potential_mV', 'solvent_for_extract', 'temperature_for_extract_C', 'duration_preparing_extract_min', 'precursor_of_np', 'concentration_of_precursor_mM', 'hydrodynamic_diameter', 'pH_during_synthesis', information.

Each article may contain multiple experiments varying by nanoparticle type, size, shape, bacteria, or other parameters. Extract all relevant data points from tables, text, or metadata, mapping them to the dataset's columns.  For each experiment extract the following information:

1. Nanoparticle name: Nanoparticle name (e.g., ""Ag"", ""Au"", ""ZnO""). 
2. Coating: Surface coating/modification (""1"" for coating, ""0"" for none).
3. Bacteria: Bacterial strain tested (e.g., ""Escherichia coli"", ""Staphylococcus aureus"").
4. MDR: Multidrug-resistant strain indicator. Extract as an integer (1 for Yes, 0 for No).
5. Strain: Specific strain identifier (e.g., ""ATCC 25922"").
6. Synthesis: Synthesis method (e.g., ""green_synthesis"", ""chemical_synthesis"", or specific details like ""Green synthesis using Pimpinella anisum""). 
7. Method: Assay type (e.g., ""MIC"", ""ZOI"", ""MBC"", ""MBEC""). 
8. MIC: Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) in μg/mL. 
9. Concentration: Concentration for Zone of Inhibition (ZOI) in μg/mL. 
10. ZOI: Zone of Inhibition in mm.

15. Time (hours): Experiment duration in hours. 
16. Zeta potential (mV): Surface charge in mV. 
17. Extraction Solvent: Solvent used in green synthesis (e.g., ""water"", ""ethanol""). 
18. Extraction Temperature (°C): Temperature during extract preparation in °C. 
19. Extraction Duration (min): Time to prepare extract in minutes. 
20. Precursor: Chemical precursor (e.g., ""AgNO3""). 
21. Precursor Concentration (mM): Precursor concentration in mM. 
22. Hydrodynamic Diameter: Hydrodynamic size in nm. 
23. Synthesis pH: pH of synthesis solution. 
Additional Instructions
1. Units: Maintain consistency with column descriptions (e.g., nm for sizes, μg/mL for concentrations, °C for temperatures). Do not convert units unless specified in the article.
2. Numeric Flags: For mdr and coating, use 1 for Yes/present and 0 for No/none.
3. Ambiguous Data: If multiple values are reported for a field (e.g., multiple sizes), select the most relevant (e.g., use size measured using TEM) or use ""Nan"" if unclear.
4. Chemical Precursors/Solvents: Extract as strings without parsing into molecular components.
If the article references multiple samples or variations of compounds tested, ensure to extract and compile each unique set of 'np', 'coating', 'bacteria', 'mdr', 'strain', 'np_synthesis', 'method', 'MIC_NP', 'concentration_for_zoi', 'zoi_np', 'np_size_min_nm', 'np_size_max_nm', 'np_size_avg_nm', 'shape', 'time_set_hours', 'zeta_potential_mV', 'solvent_for_extract', 'temperature_for_extract_C', 'duration_preparing_extract_min', 'precursor_of_np', 'concentration_of_precursor_mM', 'hydrodynamic_diameter', 'pH_during_synthesis', information.
