Each article may contain multiple experiments varying by nanoparticle type, cell line, size, shape, assay type, or concentration. For each experiment extract the following information:

1. Material: Composition of the nanoparticle/material tested (e.g., ""SiO2"", ""Ag""). 
2. Shape: Physical shape of the particle (e.g., ""Sphere"", ""Rod""). 
3. Coat Functional Group: Surface coating or functionalization (e.g., ""CTAB"", ""PEG""). 
4. Synthesis Method: Synthesis method (e.g., ""Precipitation"", ""Commercial""). 
5. Surface Charge: Reported surface charge (e.g., ""Negative"", ""Positive""). 
6. Sizes: Nanoparticle size in nm. 
6.1. Core (nm): Primary particle size in nm. 
6.2. Medium (nm): Hydrodynamic size in biological medium in nm.
6.3. Hydrodynamic (nm): Size in solution including coatings in nm.
7. Zeta: Zeta potential measurements. 
7.1 Potential (mV): Surface charge in solution in mV. 
7.2. In Medium (mV): Zeta potential in medium in mV. 
8. No of Cells (cells/well): Cell density per well in the assay. 
9. Human Animal: Origin of cells (""A"" for Animal, ""H"" for Human). 
10. Cell Source: Species/organism (e.g., ""Rat"", ""Human""). 
11. Cell Tissue: Tissue origin of the cell line (e.g., ""Adrenal Gland"", ""Lung""). 
12. Cell Morphology: Cell shape (e.g., ""Irregular"", ""Epithelial""). 
13. Cell Age: Developmental stage of cells (e.g., ""Adult"", ""Embryonic""). 
14. Time (hr): Exposure duration in hours. 
15. Concentration: Tested concentration of the material (unit-specific, e.g., μg/mL).
16. Test: Cytotoxicity assay type (e.g., ""MTT"", ""LDH""). 
17. Test Indicator: Reagent measured (e.g., ""TetrazoliumSalt"" for MTT). 
18. Viability Percent: Cell viability percentage relative to control. 

If the article references multiple samples or variations of compounds tested, ensure to extract and compile each unique set of 'Material', 'Shape', 'Coat Functional Group', 'Synthesis Method', 'Surface Charge', 'Sizes', 'Core', 'Medium', 'Hydrodynamic', 'Zeta', 'Potential', 'In Medium', 'No of Cells', 'Human Animal', 'Cell Source',  'Cell Tissue', 'Cell Morphology', 'Cell Age', 'Time', 'Concentration', 'Test', 'Test Indicator', and 'Viability Percent' information. Make sure to maintain the association between each nanoparticle and its properties. 

Additional Instructions:
1. Units: Maintain consistency with column names (e.g., nm for sizes, mV for zeta potential, hours for time, μg/mL for concentration where applicable). Do not convert units unless specified.
2. Ambiguous Data: If multiple values are reported (e.g., sizes), prioritize TEM-measured sizes for core_nm or use null if unclear. For concentration, note unit context from article if ambiguous.
3. Chemical Names: Extract material, coat_functional_group, and synthesis_method as strings in lists (e.g., [""SiO2""]) without parsing into components.
4. Error Handling: Prioritize table data over text; note assumptions for ambiguous data.
5. Viability Notes: For viability_percent, values >100% may indicate proliferation stimulation; extract as reported.

data\images\cytotoxicity\39_10.1016@j.mrgentox.2019.05.015	"You are a document retrieval assistant.You are a helpful assistant in chemistry, specializing in cytotoxic nanoparticles.Your task is to efficiently analyze the content of the provided scanned article pages and extract nanoparticle properties, cell line characteristics, and cytotoxicity outcomes, including cell viability percentages, from various research articles assessed through various assays against human or animal cell lines. Each article may contain multiple experiments varying by nanoparticle type, cell line, size, shape, assay type, or concentration. For each experiment extract the following information:

1. Material: Composition of the nanoparticle/material tested (e.g., ""SiO2"", ""Ag""). 
2. Shape: Physical shape of the particle (e.g., ""Sphere"", ""Rod""). 
3. Coat Functional Group: Surface coating or functionalization (e.g., ""CTAB"", ""PEG""). 
4. Synthesis Method: Synthesis method (e.g., ""Precipitation"", ""Commercial""). 
5. Surface Charge: Reported surface charge (e.g., ""Negative"", ""Positive""). 
6. Sizes: Nanoparticle size in nm. 
6.1. Core (nm): Primary particle size in nm. 
6.2. Medium (nm): Hydrodynamic size in biological medium in nm.
6.3. Hydrodynamic (nm): Size in solution including coatings in nm.
7. Zeta: Zeta potential measurements. 
7.1 Potential (mV): Surface charge in solution in mV. 
7.2. In Medium (mV): Zeta potential in medium in mV. 
8. No of Cells (cells/well): Cell density per well in the assay. 
9. Human Animal: Origin of cells (""A"" for Animal, ""H"" for Human). 
10. Cell Source: Species/organism (e.g., ""Rat"", ""Human""). 
11. Cell Tissue: Tissue origin of the cell line (e.g., ""Adrenal Gland"", ""Lung""). 
12. Cell Morphology: Cell shape (e.g., ""Irregular"", ""Epithelial""). 
13. Cell Age: Developmental stage of cells (e.g., ""Adult"", ""Embryonic""). 
14. Time (hr): Exposure duration in hours. 
15. Concentration: Tested concentration of the material (unit-specific, e.g., μg/mL).
16. Test: Cytotoxicity assay type (e.g., ""MTT"", ""LDH""). 
17. Test Indicator: Reagent measured (e.g., ""TetrazoliumSalt"" for MTT). 
18. Viability Percent: Cell viability percentage relative to control. 

If the article references multiple samples or variations of compounds tested, ensure to extract and compile each unique set of 'Material', 'Shape', 'Coat Functional Group', 'Synthesis Method', 'Surface Charge', 'Sizes', 'Core', 'Medium', 'Hydrodynamic', 'Zeta', 'Potential', 'In Medium', 'No of Cells', 'Human Animal', 'Cell Source',  'Cell Tissue', 'Cell Morphology', 'Cell Age', 'Time', 'Concentration', 'Test', 'Test Indicator', and 'Viability Percent' information. Make sure to maintain the association between each nanoparticle and its properties. 

Additional Instructions:
1. Units: Maintain consistency with column names (e.g., nm for sizes, mV for zeta potential, hours for time, μg/mL for concentration where applicable). Do not convert units unless specified.
2. Ambiguous Data: If multiple values are reported (e.g., sizes), prioritize TEM-measured sizes for core_nm or use null if unclear. For concentration, note unit context from article if ambiguous.
3. Chemical Names: Extract material, coat_functional_group, and synthesis_method as strings in lists (e.g., [""SiO2""]) without parsing into components.
4. Error Handling: Prioritize table data over text; note assumptions for ambiguous data.
5. Viability Notes: For viability_percent, values >100% may indicate proliferation stimulation; extract as reported.

17. Test Indicator: Reagent measured (e.g., ""TetrazoliumSalt"" for MTT). 
18. Viability Percent: Cell viability percentage relative to control. 

If the article references multiple samples or variations of compounds tested, ensure to extract and compile each unique set of 'Material', 'Shape', 'Coat Functional Group', 'Synthesis Method', 'Surface Charge', 'Sizes', 'Core', 'Medium', 'Hydrodynamic', 'Zeta', 'Potential', 'In Medium', 'No of Cells', 'Human Animal', 'Cell Source',  'Cell Tissue', 'Cell Morphology', 'Cell Age', 'Time', 'Concentration', 'Test', 'Test Indicator', and 'Viability Percent' information. Make sure to maintain the association between each nanoparticle and its properties. 

Additional Instructions:
1. Units: Maintain consistency with column names (e.g., nm for sizes, mV for zeta potential, hours for time, μg/mL for concentration where applicable). Do not convert units unless specified.
2. Ambiguous Data: If multiple values are reported (e.g., sizes), prioritize TEM-measured sizes for core_nm or use null if unclear. For concentration, note unit context from article if ambiguous.
3. Chemical Names: Extract material, coat_functional_group, and synthesis_method as strings in lists (e.g., [""SiO2""]) without parsing into components.

14. Time (hr): Exposure duration in hours. 
15. Concentration: Tested concentration of the material (unit-specific, e.g., μg/mL).
16. Test: Cytotoxicity assay type (e.g., ""MTT"", ""LDH""). 
17. Test Indicator: Reagent measured (e.g., ""TetrazoliumSalt"" for MTT). 
18. Viability Percent: Cell viability percentage relative to control. 

If the article references multiple samples or variations of compounds tested, ensure to extract and compile each unique set of 'Material', 'Shape', 'Coat Functional Group', 'Synthesis Method', 'Surface Charge', 'Sizes', 'Core', 'Medium', 'Hydrodynamic', 'Zeta', 'Potential', 'In Medium', 'No of Cells', 'Human Animal', 'Cell Source',  'Cell Tissue', 'Cell Morphology', 'Cell Age', 'Time', 'Concentration', 'Test', 'Test Indicator', and 'Viability Percent' information. Make sure to maintain the association between each nanoparticle and its properties. 

Additional Instructions:
1. Units: Maintain consistency with column names (e.g., nm for sizes, mV for zeta potential, hours for time, μg/mL for concentration where applicable). Do not convert units unless specified.
2. Ambiguous Data: If multiple values are reported (e.g., sizes), prioritize TEM-measured sizes for core_nm or use null if unclear. For concentration, note unit context from article if ambiguous.
3. Chemical Names: Extract material, coat_functional_group, and synthesis_method as strings in lists (e.g., [""SiO2""]) without parsing into components.
4. Error Handling: Prioritize table data over text; note assumptions for ambiguous data.
5. Viability Notes: For viability_percent, values >100% may indicate proliferation stimulation; extract as reported.
