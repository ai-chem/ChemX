# ChemX: A Multimodal Benchmark for Automated Information Extraction in Chemistry


## Abstract

---
ChemX is a collection of 10 manually curated benchmarking datasets developed to support robust automated information extraction in chemistry. It spans two major domains — **nanomaterials** and **small molecules** — and enables evaluation across multiple modalities including text, tables, and figures.

ChemX is designed to benchmark large language models and multi-agent systems in real-world chemical contexts, emphasizing reproducibility, schema-based annotation, and domain-specific validation.
