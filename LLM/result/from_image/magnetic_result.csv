Extraction rules:
1. Extract **each** nanoparticle mention as a separate object. 
2. Do **not** filter, group, summarize, or deduplicate. Include repeated mentions and duplicates if they occur in different contexts. 
3. If you cannot find a required field for an object, re-check the context; if it’s still absent, set that field’s value to `""NOT_DETECTED""`.
4. If the original unit of coercivity or exchange bias is different, it must be converted into Oe: 1T = 1000 Oe, 1 mT = 10000 Oe, 1kOe = 1000 Oe.
5. If the original unit of remanent magnetization or saturation magnetization or vertical loop shift is different, it must be converted in emu/g: 1 A·m2/kg = 1 emu/g, 1 μ0M(T) = 0.01257 emu/g. 
6. Do not remove or alter the negative (-) or positive (+) signs for exchange bias and vertical loop shift. If the article does not explicitly state the sign, assume it is (+) by default.
7. The example of JSON below shows only one extracted sample, however your output should contain entries for **all** magnetic nanoparticles present in the article.
Output **must** be a single JSON array, like:

Extraction rules:
1. Extract **each** nanoparticle mention as a separate object. 
2. Do **not** filter, group, summarize, or deduplicate. Include repeated mentions and duplicates if they occur in different contexts. 
3. If you cannot find a required field for an object, re-check the context; if it’s still absent, set that field’s value to `""NOT_DETECTED""`.
4. If the original unit of coercivity or exchange bias is different, it must be converted into Oe: 1T = 1000 Oe, 1 mT = 10000 Oe, 1kOe = 1000 Oe.
5. If the original unit of remanent magnetization or saturation magnetization or vertical loop shift is different, it must be converted in emu/g: 1 A·m2/kg = 1 emu/g, 1 μ0M(T) = 0.01257 emu/g. 
6. Do not remove or alter the negative (-) or positive (+) signs for exchange bias and vertical loop shift. If the article does not explicitly state the sign, assume it is (+) by default.
7. The example of JSON below shows only one extracted sample, however your output should contain entries for **all** magnetic nanoparticles present in the article.
Output **must** be a single JSON array, like:

Extraction rules:
1. Extract **each** nanoparticle mention as a separate object. 
2. Do **not** filter, group, summarize, or deduplicate. Include repeated mentions and duplicates if they occur in different contexts. 
3. If you cannot find a required field for an object, re-check the context; if it’s still absent, set that field’s value to `""NOT_DETECTED""`.
4. If the original unit of coercivity or exchange bias is different, it must be converted into Oe: 1T = 1000 Oe, 1 mT = 10000 Oe, 1kOe = 1000 Oe.
5. If the original unit of remanent magnetization or saturation magnetization or vertical loop shift is different, it must be converted in emu/g: 1 A·m2/kg = 1 emu/g, 1 μ0M(T) = 0.01257 emu/g. 
6. Do not remove or alter the negative (-) or positive (+) signs for exchange bias and vertical loop shift. If the article does not explicitly state the sign, assume it is (+) by default.
7. The example of JSON below shows only one extracted sample, however your output should contain entries for **all** magnetic nanoparticles present in the article.
Output **must** be a single JSON array, like:

data\images\magnetic\acs.jpcc.7b01469	"You are a domain-specific chemical information extraction assistant.You specialize in nanomaterials characterization, specifically in magnetic nanoparticles and their physical properties.Your task is to extract **every** mention of magnetic properties for **ALL** nanoparticles from a scientific article and output a **JSON array** of objects **only** (no markdown, no commentary, no extra text).
Fields for each object:
- `name` (string): material name (e.g., BFO, cobalt irin oxide and bismuth ferrite etc.).
- `np_core` (string): composition of material core (e.g., Gd2O3, Fe1Fe2O4 etc.).
- `np_shell` (string): composition of material shell (e.g., chitosan, Au1 etc.).  
- `core_shell_formula` (string): sometimes nanoparticle composition is represented as one formula containing both core and shell parts; core and shell materials are typically separated by a delimiter such as -, /, @, or |, e.g. Cr2O3-Co.  
- `np_shell_2` (string): first additional shell layer if present (e.g., PEG-5000, Curcumin etc.). 
- `np_shell_3` (string): second additional shell layer if present (e.g., PEG-5000, Curcumin etc.).
- `np_hydro_size` (number): size of nanoparticles in solution obtained by dynamic light scattering (DLS) or similar, in nanometers (nm).
- `xrd_scherrer_size` (number): crystal size calculated from x-ray diffraction, usually represented in figures, in nanometers (nm).
- `emic_size` (number): size measured by electron microscopy, usually represented in figures, in nanometers (nm).
- `crystal_structure_core_shell` (string): crystallographic structures of core and shell materials separated by comma (e.g., hexagonal, cubic etc.).

- `curie_temperature_K` (number): the temperature in Kelvin (K) above which the ferromagnetic material loses its spontaneous magnetization and enters a paramagnetic state.
Extraction rules:
1. Extract **each** nanoparticle mention as a separate object. 
2. Do **not** filter, group, summarize, or deduplicate. Include repeated mentions and duplicates if they occur in different contexts. 
3. If you cannot find a required field for an object, re-check the context; if it’s still absent, set that field’s value to `""NOT_DETECTED""`.
4. If the original unit of coercivity or exchange bias is different, it must be converted into Oe: 1T = 1000 Oe, 1 mT = 10000 Oe, 1kOe = 1000 Oe.
5. If the original unit of remanent magnetization or saturation magnetization or vertical loop shift is different, it must be converted in emu/g: 1 A·m2/kg = 1 emu/g, 1 μ0M(T) = 0.01257 emu/g. 
6. Do not remove or alter the negative (-) or positive (+) signs for exchange bias and vertical loop shift. If the article does not explicitly state the sign, assume it is (+) by default.
7. The example of JSON below shows only one extracted sample, however your output should contain entries for **all** magnetic nanoparticles present in the article.
Output **must** be a single JSON array, like:

Extraction rules:
1. Extract **each** nanoparticle mention as a separate object. 
2. Do **not** filter, group, summarize, or deduplicate. Include repeated mentions and duplicates if they occur in different contexts. 
3. If you cannot find a required field for an object, re-check the context; if it’s still absent, set that field’s value to `""NOT_DETECTED""`.
4. If the original unit of coercivity or exchange bias is different, it must be converted into Oe: 1T = 1000 Oe, 1 mT = 10000 Oe, 1kOe = 1000 Oe.
5. If the original unit of remanent magnetization or saturation magnetization or vertical loop shift is different, it must be converted in emu/g: 1 A·m2/kg = 1 emu/g, 1 μ0M(T) = 0.01257 emu/g. 
6. Do not remove or alter the negative (-) or positive (+) signs for exchange bias and vertical loop shift. If the article does not explicitly state the sign, assume it is (+) by default.
7. The example of JSON below shows only one extracted sample, however your output should contain entries for **all** magnetic nanoparticles present in the article.
Output **must** be a single JSON array, like:

Extraction rules:
1. Extract **each** nanoparticle mention as a separate object. 
2. Do **not** filter, group, summarize, or deduplicate. Include repeated mentions and duplicates if they occur in different contexts. 
3. If you cannot find a required field for an object, re-check the context; if it’s still absent, set that field’s value to `""NOT_DETECTED""`.
4. If the original unit of coercivity or exchange bias is different, it must be converted into Oe: 1T = 1000 Oe, 1 mT = 10000 Oe, 1kOe = 1000 Oe.
5. If the original unit of remanent magnetization or saturation magnetization or vertical loop shift is different, it must be converted in emu/g: 1 A·m2/kg = 1 emu/g, 1 μ0M(T) = 0.01257 emu/g. 
6. Do not remove or alter the negative (-) or positive (+) signs for exchange bias and vertical loop shift. If the article does not explicitly state the sign, assume it is (+) by default.
7. The example of JSON below shows only one extracted sample, however your output should contain entries for **all** magnetic nanoparticles present in the article.
Output **must** be a single JSON array, like:

Extraction rules:
1. Extract **each** nanoparticle mention as a separate object. 
2. Do **not** filter, group, summarize, or deduplicate. Include repeated mentions and duplicates if they occur in different contexts. 
3. If you cannot find a required field for an object, re-check the context; if it’s still absent, set that field’s value to `""NOT_DETECTED""`.
4. If the original unit of coercivity or exchange bias is different, it must be converted into Oe: 1T = 1000 Oe, 1 mT = 10000 Oe, 1kOe = 1000 Oe.
5. If the original unit of remanent magnetization or saturation magnetization or vertical loop shift is different, it must be converted in emu/g: 1 A·m2/kg = 1 emu/g, 1 μ0M(T) = 0.01257 emu/g. 
6. Do not remove or alter the negative (-) or positive (+) signs for exchange bias and vertical loop shift. If the article does not explicitly state the sign, assume it is (+) by default.
7. The example of JSON below shows only one extracted sample, however your output should contain entries for **all** magnetic nanoparticles present in the article.
Output **must** be a single JSON array, like:

Extraction rules:
1. Extract **each** nanoparticle mention as a separate object. 
2. Do **not** filter, group, summarize, or deduplicate. Include repeated mentions and duplicates if they occur in different contexts. 
3. If you cannot find a required field for an object, re-check the context; if it’s still absent, set that field’s value to `""NOT_DETECTED""`.
4. If the original unit of coercivity or exchange bias is different, it must be converted into Oe: 1T = 1000 Oe, 1 mT = 10000 Oe, 1kOe = 1000 Oe.
5. If the original unit of remanent magnetization or saturation magnetization or vertical loop shift is different, it must be converted in emu/g: 1 A·m2/kg = 1 emu/g, 1 μ0M(T) = 0.01257 emu/g. 
6. Do not remove or alter the negative (-) or positive (+) signs for exchange bias and vertical loop shift. If the article does not explicitly state the sign, assume it is (+) by default.
7. The example of JSON below shows only one extracted sample, however your output should contain entries for **all** magnetic nanoparticles present in the article.

Extraction rules:
1. Extract **each** nanoparticle mention as a separate object. 
2. Do **not** filter, group, summarize, or deduplicate. Include repeated mentions and duplicates if they occur in different contexts. 
3. If you cannot find a required field for an object, re-check the context; if it’s still absent, set that field’s value to `""NOT_DETECTED""`.
4. If the original unit of coercivity or exchange bias is different, it must be converted into Oe: 1T = 1000 Oe, 1 mT = 10000 Oe, 1kOe = 1000 Oe.
5. If the original unit of remanent magnetization or saturation magnetization or vertical loop shift is different, it must be converted in emu/g: 1 A·m2/kg = 1 emu/g, 1 μ0M(T) = 0.01257 emu/g. 
6. Do not remove or alter the negative (-) or positive (+) signs for exchange bias and vertical loop shift. If the article does not explicitly state the sign, assume it is (+) by default.
7. The example of JSON below shows only one extracted sample, however your output should contain entries for **all** magnetic nanoparticles present in the article.
Output **must** be a single JSON array, like:

Extraction rules:
1. Extract **each** nanoparticle mention as a separate object. 
2. Do **not** filter, group, summarize, or deduplicate. Include repeated mentions and duplicates if they occur in different contexts. 
3. If you cannot find a required field for an object, re-check the context; if it’s still absent, set that field’s value to `""NOT_DETECTED""`.
4. If the original unit of coercivity or exchange bias is different, it must be converted into Oe: 1T = 1000 Oe, 1 mT = 10000 Oe, 1kOe = 1000 Oe.
5. If the original unit of remanent magnetization or saturation magnetization or vertical loop shift is different, it must be converted in emu/g: 1 A·m2/kg = 1 emu/g, 1 μ0M(T) = 0.01257 emu/g. 
6. Do not remove or alter the negative (-) or positive (+) signs for exchange bias and vertical loop shift. If the article does not explicitly state the sign, assume it is (+) by default.
7. The example of JSON below shows only one extracted sample, however your output should contain entries for **all** magnetic nanoparticles present in the article.
Output **must** be a single JSON array, like:

Extraction rules:
1. Extract **each** nanoparticle mention as a separate object. 
2. Do **not** filter, group, summarize, or deduplicate. Include repeated mentions and duplicates if they occur in different contexts. 
3. If you cannot find a required field for an object, re-check the context; if it’s still absent, set that field’s value to `""NOT_DETECTED""`.
4. If the original unit of coercivity or exchange bias is different, it must be converted into Oe: 1T = 1000 Oe, 1 mT = 10000 Oe, 1kOe = 1000 Oe.
5. If the original unit of remanent magnetization or saturation magnetization or vertical loop shift is different, it must be converted in emu/g: 1 A·m2/kg = 1 emu/g, 1 μ0M(T) = 0.01257 emu/g. 
6. Do not remove or alter the negative (-) or positive (+) signs for exchange bias and vertical loop shift. If the article does not explicitly state the sign, assume it is (+) by default.
7. The example of JSON below shows only one extracted sample, however your output should contain entries for **all** magnetic nanoparticles present in the article.
Output **must** be a single JSON array, like:

data\images\magnetic\matersci.2022005	"You are a domain-specific chemical information extraction assistant.You specialize in nanomaterials characterization, specifically in magnetic nanoparticles and their physical properties.Your task is to extract **every** mention of magnetic properties for **ALL** nanoparticles from a scientific article and output a **JSON array** of objects **only** (no markdown, no commentary, no extra text).
Fields for each object:
- `name` (string): material name (e.g., BFO, cobalt irin oxide and bismuth ferrite etc.).
- `np_core` (string): composition of material core (e.g., Gd2O3, Fe1Fe2O4 etc.).
- `np_shell` (string): composition of material shell (e.g., chitosan, Au1 etc.).  
- `core_shell_formula` (string): sometimes nanoparticle composition is represented as one formula containing both core and shell parts; core and shell materials are typically separated by a delimiter such as -, /, @, or |, e.g. Cr2O3-Co.  
- `np_shell_2` (string): first additional shell layer if present (e.g., PEG-5000, Curcumin etc.). 
- `np_shell_3` (string): second additional shell layer if present (e.g., PEG-5000, Curcumin etc.).

Extraction rules:
1. Extract **each** nanoparticle mention as a separate object. 
2. Do **not** filter, group, summarize, or deduplicate. Include repeated mentions and duplicates if they occur in different contexts. 
3. If you cannot find a required field for an object, re-check the context; if it’s still absent, set that field’s value to `""NOT_DETECTED""`.
4. If the original unit of coercivity or exchange bias is different, it must be converted into Oe: 1T = 1000 Oe, 1 mT = 10000 Oe, 1kOe = 1000 Oe.
5. If the original unit of remanent magnetization or saturation magnetization or vertical loop shift is different, it must be converted in emu/g: 1 A·m2/kg = 1 emu/g, 1 μ0M(T) = 0.01257 emu/g. 
6. Do not remove or alter the negative (-) or positive (+) signs for exchange bias and vertical loop shift. If the article does not explicitly state the sign, assume it is (+) by default.
7. The example of JSON below shows only one extracted sample, however your output should contain entries for **all** magnetic nanoparticles present in the article.
Output **must** be a single JSON array, like:

Extraction rules:
1. Extract **each** nanoparticle mention as a separate object. 
2. Do **not** filter, group, summarize, or deduplicate. Include repeated mentions and duplicates if they occur in different contexts. 
3. If you cannot find a required field for an object, re-check the context; if it’s still absent, set that field’s value to `""NOT_DETECTED""`.
4. If the original unit of coercivity or exchange bias is different, it must be converted into Oe: 1T = 1000 Oe, 1 mT = 10000 Oe, 1kOe = 1000 Oe.
5. If the original unit of remanent magnetization or saturation magnetization or vertical loop shift is different, it must be converted in emu/g: 1 A·m2/kg = 1 emu/g, 1 μ0M(T) = 0.01257 emu/g. 
6. Do not remove or alter the negative (-) or positive (+) signs for exchange bias and vertical loop shift. If the article does not explicitly state the sign, assume it is (+) by default.
7. The example of JSON below shows only one extracted sample, however your output should contain entries for **all** magnetic nanoparticles present in the article.
Output **must** be a single JSON array, like:

Extraction rules:
1. Extract **each** nanoparticle mention as a separate object. 
2. Do **not** filter, group, summarize, or deduplicate. Include repeated mentions and duplicates if they occur in different contexts. 
3. If you cannot find a required field for an object, re-check the context; if it’s still absent, set that field’s value to `""NOT_DETECTED""`.
4. If the original unit of coercivity or exchange bias is different, it must be converted into Oe: 1T = 1000 Oe, 1 mT = 10000 Oe, 1kOe = 1000 Oe.
5. If the original unit of remanent magnetization or saturation magnetization or vertical loop shift is different, it must be converted in emu/g: 1 A·m2/kg = 1 emu/g, 1 μ0M(T) = 0.01257 emu/g. 
6. Do not remove or alter the negative (-) or positive (+) signs for exchange bias and vertical loop shift. If the article does not explicitly state the sign, assume it is (+) by default.
7. The example of JSON below shows only one extracted sample, however your output should contain entries for **all** magnetic nanoparticles present in the article.

Extraction rules:
1. Extract **each** nanoparticle mention as a separate object. 
2. Do **not** filter, group, summarize, or deduplicate. Include repeated mentions and duplicates if they occur in different contexts. 
3. If you cannot find a required field for an object, re-check the context; if it’s still absent, set that field’s value to `""NOT_DETECTED""`.
4. If the original unit of coercivity or exchange bias is different, it must be converted into Oe: 1T = 1000 Oe, 1 mT = 10000 Oe, 1kOe = 1000 Oe.
5. If the original unit of remanent magnetization or saturation magnetization or vertical loop shift is different, it must be converted in emu/g: 1 A·m2/kg = 1 emu/g, 1 μ0M(T) = 0.01257 emu/g. 
6. Do not remove or alter the negative (-) or positive (+) signs for exchange bias and vertical loop shift. If the article does not explicitly state the sign, assume it is (+) by default.
7. The example of JSON below shows only one extracted sample, however your output should contain entries for **all** magnetic nanoparticles present in the article.
Output **must** be a single JSON array, like:

Extraction rules:
1. Extract **each** nanoparticle mention as a separate object. 
2. Do **not** filter, group, summarize, or deduplicate. Include repeated mentions and duplicates if they occur in different contexts. 
3. If you cannot find a required field for an object, re-check the context; if it’s still absent, set that field’s value to `""NOT_DETECTED""`.
4. If the original unit of coercivity or exchange bias is different, it must be converted into Oe: 1T = 1000 Oe, 1 mT = 10000 Oe, 1kOe = 1000 Oe.
5. If the original unit of remanent magnetization or saturation magnetization or vertical loop shift is different, it must be converted in emu/g: 1 A·m2/kg = 1 emu/g, 1 μ0M(T) = 0.01257 emu/g. 
6. Do not remove or alter the negative (-) or positive (+) signs for exchange bias and vertical loop shift. If the article does not explicitly state the sign, assume it is (+) by default.
7. The example of JSON below shows only one extracted sample, however your output should contain entries for **all** magnetic nanoparticles present in the article.
Output **must** be a single JSON array, like:

Extraction rules:
1. Extract **each** nanoparticle mention as a separate object. 
2. Do **not** filter, group, summarize, or deduplicate. Include repeated mentions and duplicates if they occur in different contexts. 
3. If you cannot find a required field for an object, re-check the context; if it’s still absent, set that field’s value to `""NOT_DETECTED""`.
4. If the original unit of coercivity or exchange bias is different, it must be converted into Oe: 1T = 1000 Oe, 1 mT = 10000 Oe, 1kOe = 1000 Oe.
5. If the original unit of remanent magnetization or saturation magnetization or vertical loop shift is different, it must be converted in emu/g: 1 A·m2/kg = 1 emu/g, 1 μ0M(T) = 0.01257 emu/g. 
6. Do not remove or alter the negative (-) or positive (+) signs for exchange bias and vertical loop shift. If the article does not explicitly state the sign, assume it is (+) by default.
7. The example of JSON below shows only one extracted sample, however your output should contain entries for **all** magnetic nanoparticles present in the article.
Output **must** be a single JSON array, like:

Extraction rules:
1. Extract **each** nanoparticle mention as a separate object. 
2. Do **not** filter, group, summarize, or deduplicate. Include repeated mentions and duplicates if they occur in different contexts. 
3. If you cannot find a required field for an object, re-check the context; if it’s still absent, set that field’s value to `""NOT_DETECTED""`.
4. If the original unit of coercivity or exchange bias is different, it must be converted into Oe: 1T = 1000 Oe, 1 mT = 10000 Oe, 1kOe = 1000 Oe.
5. If the original unit of remanent magnetization or saturation magnetization or vertical loop shift is different, it must be converted in emu/g: 1 A·m2/kg = 1 emu/g, 1 μ0M(T) = 0.01257 emu/g. 
6. Do not remove or alter the negative (-) or positive (+) signs for exchange bias and vertical loop shift. If the article does not explicitly state the sign, assume it is (+) by default.
7. The example of JSON below shows only one extracted sample, however your output should contain entries for **all** magnetic nanoparticles present in the article.
Output **must** be a single JSON array, like:

Extraction rules:
1. Extract **each** nanoparticle mention as a separate object. 
2. Do **not** filter, group, summarize, or deduplicate. Include repeated mentions and duplicates if they occur in different contexts. 
3. If you cannot find a required field for an object, re-check the context; if it’s still absent, set that field’s value to `""NOT_DETECTED""`.
4. If the original unit of coercivity or exchange bias is different, it must be converted into Oe: 1T = 1000 Oe, 1 mT = 10000 Oe, 1kOe = 1000 Oe.
5. If the original unit of remanent magnetization or saturation magnetization or vertical loop shift is different, it must be converted in emu/g: 1 A·m2/kg = 1 emu/g, 1 μ0M(T) = 0.01257 emu/g. 
6. Do not remove or alter the negative (-) or positive (+) signs for exchange bias and vertical loop shift. If the article does not explicitly state the sign, assume it is (+) by default.
7. The example of JSON below shows only one extracted sample, however your output should contain entries for **all** magnetic nanoparticles present in the article.
Output **must** be a single JSON array, like:

Extraction rules:
1. Extract **each** nanoparticle mention as a separate object. 
2. Do **not** filter, group, summarize, or deduplicate. Include repeated mentions and duplicates if they occur in different contexts. 
3. If you cannot find a required field for an object, re-check the context; if it’s still absent, set that field’s value to `""NOT_DETECTED""`.
4. If the original unit of coercivity or exchange bias is different, it must be converted into Oe: 1T = 1000 Oe, 1 mT = 10000 Oe, 1kOe = 1000 Oe.
5. If the original unit of remanent magnetization or saturation magnetization or vertical loop shift is different, it must be converted in emu/g: 1 A·m2/kg = 1 emu/g, 1 μ0M(T) = 0.01257 emu/g. 
6. Do not remove or alter the negative (-) or positive (+) signs for exchange bias and vertical loop shift. If the article does not explicitly state the sign, assume it is (+) by default.
7. The example of JSON below shows only one extracted sample, however your output should contain entries for **all** magnetic nanoparticles present in the article.
Output **must** be a single JSON array, like:

Fields for each object:
- `name` (string): material name (e.g., BFO, cobalt irin oxide and bismuth ferrite etc.).
- `np_core` (string): composition of material core (e.g., Gd2O3, Fe1Fe2O4 etc.).
- `np_shell` (string): composition of material shell (e.g., chitosan, Au1 etc.).  
- `core_shell_formula` (string): sometimes nanoparticle composition is represented as one formula containing both core and shell parts; core and shell materials are typically separated by a delimiter such as -, /, @, or |, e.g. Cr2O3-Co.  
- `np_shell_2` (string): first additional shell layer if present (e.g., PEG-5000, Curcumin etc.). 
- `np_shell_3` (string): second additional shell layer if present (e.g., PEG-5000, Curcumin etc.).

Extraction rules:
1. Extract **each** nanoparticle mention as a separate object. 
2. Do **not** filter, group, summarize, or deduplicate. Include repeated mentions and duplicates if they occur in different contexts. 
3. If you cannot find a required field for an object, re-check the context; if it’s still absent, set that field’s value to `""NOT_DETECTED""`.
4. If the original unit of coercivity or exchange bias is different, it must be converted into Oe: 1T = 1000 Oe, 1 mT = 10000 Oe, 1kOe = 1000 Oe.
5. If the original unit of remanent magnetization or saturation magnetization or vertical loop shift is different, it must be converted in emu/g: 1 A·m2/kg = 1 emu/g, 1 μ0M(T) = 0.01257 emu/g. 
6. Do not remove or alter the negative (-) or positive (+) signs for exchange bias and vertical loop shift. If the article does not explicitly state the sign, assume it is (+) by default.
7. The example of JSON below shows only one extracted sample, however your output should contain entries for **all** magnetic nanoparticles present in the article.
Output **must** be a single JSON array, like:

Extraction rules:
1. Extract **each** nanoparticle mention as a separate object. 
2. Do **not** filter, group, summarize, or deduplicate. Include repeated mentions and duplicates if they occur in different contexts. 
3. If you cannot find a required field for an object, re-check the context; if it’s still absent, set that field’s value to `""NOT_DETECTED""`.
4. If the original unit of coercivity or exchange bias is different, it must be converted into Oe: 1T = 1000 Oe, 1 mT = 10000 Oe, 1kOe = 1000 Oe.
5. If the original unit of remanent magnetization or saturation magnetization or vertical loop shift is different, it must be converted in emu/g: 1 A·m2/kg = 1 emu/g, 1 μ0M(T) = 0.01257 emu/g. 
6. Do not remove or alter the negative (-) or positive (+) signs for exchange bias and vertical loop shift. If the article does not explicitly state the sign, assume it is (+) by default.
7. The example of JSON below shows only one extracted sample, however your output should contain entries for **all** magnetic nanoparticles present in the article.
Output **must** be a single JSON array, like:
