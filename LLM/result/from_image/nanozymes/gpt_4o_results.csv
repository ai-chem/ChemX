3. Crystal System: crystal unit (usually cubic, hexagonal, tetragonal, monoclinic, orthorhombic, trigonal, amorphous, or triclinic)
4. Length (nm): length of the nanozyme particle
5. Width (nm): width of the nanozyme particle
6. Depth (nm): depth of the nanozyme particle
7. Surface Molecule: naked by default or poly(ethylene oxide), poly(N-Vinylpyrrolidone), Tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphine, or other)
8. Km Value: Michaelis constant numerical value
9. Km Unit: unit for Km (typically mM)
10. Vmax Value: molar maximum reaction rate numerical value
11. Vmax Unit: unit for Vmax (typically µmol/min, mol/min, etc.)
12. Reaction Type: (substrate + co-substrate) (TMB + H2O2, H2O2 + TMB, TMB, ABTS + H2O2, H2O2, OPD + H2O2, H2O2 + GSH, or other)
13. C_min (mM): Minimum substrate concentration in catalytic assays
14. C_max (mM): Maximum substrate concentration in catalytic assays
15. Co-substrate Concentration Value: Constant co-substrate concentration during assays
16. Co-substrate Unit: Unit of measurement for co-substrate
17. Catalyst Concentration Value: Catalyst concentration used in assays
18. Catalyst Unit: Unit of measurement for catalyst concentration
19. pH Level: pH at which experiments were conducted
20. Temperature (°C): Temperature in Celsius during the study

If the article references multiple samples or variations of compounds tested, ensure to extract and compile each unique set of 'Formula', 'Activity Type', 'Crystal System', 'Length ', 'Width', 'Surface Molecule', 'Km Value', 'Km Unit', 'Vmax Value', 'Vmax Unit', 'Reaction Type', 'C_min', 'C_max', 'Co-substrate Concentration Value', 'Co-substrate Unit', 'Catalyst Concentration Value', 'Catalyst Unit', 'pH Level', and 'Temperature' information. Ensure that you maintain the association between each nanozyme and its corresponding properties.

You need to find all the experiments with different values mentioned in the article and write about each of them separately. It is imperative that each of these elements is addressed independently for every experiment, providing a complete and isolated description with accurate measurements in appropriate units. This approach will ensure a comprehensive and clear understanding of each experiment as an individual entity within the scientific literature on nanozymes.

Do not skip any entries. It is imperative that you should not make up any additional information or take the information you already know. If you did not find the parameter in the text, write 'NaN'.

You need to find all the experiments with different values mentioned in the article and write about each of them separately. It is imperative that each of these elements is addressed independently for every experiment, providing a complete and isolated description with accurate measurements in appropriate units. This approach will ensure a comprehensive and clear understanding of each experiment as an individual entity within the scientific literature on nanozymes.

Do not skip any entries. It is imperative that you should not make up any additional information or take the information you already know. If you did not find the parameter in the text, write 'NaN'.

You need to find all the experiments with different values mentioned in the article and write about each of them separately. It is imperative that each of these elements is addressed independently for every experiment, providing a complete and isolated description with accurate measurements in appropriate units. This approach will ensure a comprehensive and clear understanding of each experiment as an individual entity within the scientific literature on nanozymes.

Do not skip any entries. It is imperative that you should not make up any additional information or take the information you already know. If you did not find the parameter in the text, write 'NaN'.

You need to find all the experiments with different values mentioned in the article and write about each of them separately. It is imperative that each of these elements is addressed independently for every experiment, providing a complete and isolated description with accurate measurements in appropriate units. This approach will ensure a comprehensive and clear understanding of each experiment as an individual entity within the scientific literature on nanozymes.

Do not skip any entries. It is imperative that you should not make up any additional information or take the information you already know. If you did not find the parameter in the text, write 'NaN'.

You need to find all the experiments with different values mentioned in the article and write about each of them separately. It is imperative that each of these elements is addressed independently for every experiment, providing a complete and isolated description with accurate measurements in appropriate units. This approach will ensure a comprehensive and clear understanding of each experiment as an individual entity within the scientific literature on nanozymes.

Do not skip any entries. It is imperative that you should not make up any additional information or take the information you already know. If you did not find the parameter in the text, write 'NaN'.

You need to find all the experiments with different values mentioned in the article and write about each of them separately. It is imperative that each of these elements is addressed independently for every experiment, providing a complete and isolated description with accurate measurements in appropriate units. This approach will ensure a comprehensive and clear understanding of each experiment as an individual entity within the scientific literature on nanozymes.

Do not skip any entries. It is imperative that you should not make up any additional information or take the information you already know. If you did not find the parameter in the text, write 'NaN'.
