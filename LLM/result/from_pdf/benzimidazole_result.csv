s41598-022-21435-6.pdf,You are a domain-specific chemical information extraction assistant.,"You specialize in chemistry of small molecules. In particular, your area is antibiotics and their properties.","Your task is to extract **every** mention of MIC or pMIC measurements against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli bacteria for **ALL** benzimidazole antibiotics from a scientific article and output a **JSON array** of objects **only** (no markdown, no commentary, no extra text).
Fields for each object:
- `compound_id` (string): ID of a molecule within the article, as cited in the text, e.g. `""5a""`, `""Compound 3""`.
- `smiles` (string): full SMILES representation of a benzimidazole antibiotic.
- `target_type` (string): type of measurement, either `""MIC""` or `""pMIC""`, exactly as stated.  
- `target_relation` (string): one of `""=""`, `""<""`, or `"">""`. If no relation symbol is shown, use `""=""`.  
- `target_value` (number): the numeric value of MIC/pMIC (without quotes).  
- `target_units` (string): MIC units, e.g. `""μg/mL""`, `""mg/L""`, etc.  
- `bacteria` (string): the organism against which MIC/pMIC was measured, named exactly as in the text.
Extraction rules:
1. Extract **each** MIC/pMIC mention as a separate object. If multiple MIC/pMIC are reported for the same compound against different bacteria, list them as separate entries.
2. Do **not** filter, group, summarize, or deduplicate. Include repeated mentions and duplicates if they occur in different contexts. 
3. If a range is given (e.g., “2–8 μg/mL”), leave it as a range. 
4. If a molecule is fully depicted in a figure, write it as a SMILES string. If a molecule is depicted as a scaffold and residues separately in different places of an article, connect them by compound ID into one molecule and write it as a single SMILES string.
5. Extract only measurements with Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Record full names, abbreviations, or any related taxonomic identifiers of bacteria.
6. If you cannot find a required field for an object, re-check the context; if it’s still absent, set that field’s value to `""NOT_DETECTED""`.
7. The example of JSON below shows only two extracted samples, however your output should contain **all** MIC or pMIC measurements of benzimidazole antibiotics present in the article.
Output **must** be a single JSON array, like:

1. Extract **each** MIC/pMIC mention as a separate object. If multiple MIC/pMIC are reported for the same compound against different bacteria, list them as separate entries.
2. Do **not** filter, group, summarize, or deduplicate. Include repeated mentions and duplicates if they occur in different contexts. 
3. If a range is given (e.g., “2–8 μg/mL”), leave it as a range. 
4. If a molecule is fully depicted in a figure, write it as a SMILES string. If a molecule is depicted as a scaffold and residues separately in different places of an article, connect them by compound ID into one molecule and write it as a single SMILES string.
5. Extract only measurements with Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Record full names, abbreviations, or any related taxonomic identifiers of bacteria.
6. If you cannot find a required field for an object, re-check the context; if it’s still absent, set that field’s value to `""NOT_DETECTED""`.
7. The example of JSON below shows only two extracted samples, however your output should contain **all** MIC or pMIC measurements of benzimidazole antibiotics present in the article.
Output **must** be a single JSON array, like:

d2ra06667j.pdf,You are a domain-specific chemical information extraction assistant.,"You specialize in chemistry of small molecules. In particular, your area is antibiotics and their properties.","Your task is to extract **every** mention of MIC or pMIC measurements against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli bacteria for **ALL** benzimidazole antibiotics from a scientific article and output a **JSON array** of objects **only** (no markdown, no commentary, no extra text).
Fields for each object:
- `compound_id` (string): ID of a molecule within the article, as cited in the text, e.g. `""5a""`, `""Compound 3""`.
- `smiles` (string): full SMILES representation of a benzimidazole antibiotic.
- `target_type` (string): type of measurement, either `""MIC""` or `""pMIC""`, exactly as stated.  
- `target_relation` (string): one of `""=""`, `""<""`, or `"">""`. If no relation symbol is shown, use `""=""`.  
- `target_value` (number): the numeric value of MIC/pMIC (without quotes).  
- `target_units` (string): MIC units, e.g. `""μg/mL""`, `""mg/L""`, etc.  
- `bacteria` (string): the organism against which MIC/pMIC was measured, named exactly as in the text.
Extraction rules:
1. Extract **each** MIC/pMIC mention as a separate object. If multiple MIC/pMIC are reported for the same compound against different bacteria, list them as separate entries.
2. Do **not** filter, group, summarize, or deduplicate. Include repeated mentions and duplicates if they occur in different contexts. 
3. If a range is given (e.g., “2–8 μg/mL”), leave it as a range. 
4. If a molecule is fully depicted in a figure, write it as a SMILES string. If a molecule is depicted as a scaffold and residues separately in different places of an article, connect them by compound ID into one molecule and write it as a single SMILES string.
5. Extract only measurements with Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Record full names, abbreviations, or any related taxonomic identifiers of bacteria.
6. If you cannot find a required field for an object, re-check the context; if it’s still absent, set that field’s value to `""NOT_DETECTED""`.
7. The example of JSON below shows only two extracted samples, however your output should contain **all** MIC or pMIC measurements of benzimidazole antibiotics present in the article.
Output **must** be a single JSON array, like:
[
  {
    ""compound_id"": ""11h"",
    ""smiles"": ""O=C(OCC)C1=C(N(C(=O)N(C1C2=C(C=CS2)C)[H])[H])C[N]3C=NC4=C3C=C(C=C4)[N+](=O)[O-]"",
    ""target_type"": ""MIC"",
    ""target_relation"": ""<"",
    ""target_value"": 1,
    ""target_units"": ""mmol/l"",
    ""bacteria"": ""methicillin-susceptible S. aureus""
  },
  {
    ""compound_id"": ""5a"",
    ""smiles"": ""CCN1C=C(C(=O)C2=CC(=C(C=C21)N3CCN(CC3)C4=NC=CC(=N4)N)F)C(=O)O"",
    ""target_type"": ""pMIC"",
    ""target_relation"": ""<"",
    ""target_value"": 2,

    ""bacteria"": ""Escherichia coli""
  }
